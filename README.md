# byebyte - destroy your files in the name of art

![](http://i.imgur.com/2LR6uGK.jpg)

## What?

**byebyte** is a command line tool written in Node.js that replaces random bytes in a file with random values.

## Why would I want to do that?

Because you like [glitch art](http://www.reddit.com/r/glitch_art) or you just need to destroy arbitrary data in a file for some reason while leaving most of it intact. Potential uses:

- Destroying various image files
- Glitching video files
- Randomizing text files
- Breaking your essay file so that your teacher can't open it and you get your deadline extended

## How?

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run this file, so you need that installed first. You'll also need to learn [how to use a command line](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything). Once you have Node, you can install byebyte pretty easily:

```
npm install -g byebyte
```

You're set up! Now you can run byebyte like this:

`byebyte -f <inputfile> -o <outputfile> [more options]`

For example, if you wanted to destroy a text file, you would run:

`byebyte -f poem.txt -o newpoem.txt`

This short little poem:

```
Little Baby

Little baby Oh so small 
One day you will be big and tall
I watch you while you laugh and play 
My love for you grows everyday 
I tell you this with my whole heart
I love you just the way you are
```

becomes:

```
Little Baby

Little baby Oh ¬±oDsmall 
2neHday√†you wil be2digJa√±dtall
 watchyou√¨w¬∞ile9you l¬≥ugh and play 
My loe fr*you √µrHws everydayB
‚Äö tell you√ñt¬≥is with my√§√èholeheart
I Zove √≥ou just the way you are
```

### Parameters

parameter | meaning | default
----- | ----- | -----
`-f, --file` | input file path | none, required
`-o, --out` | output file path | none, required
`-t, --times` | number of bytes to replace | 50
`--min` | (real number, 0.0 - 1.0) - the lower bound of the file to replace bytes in. you might use this to avoid corrupting the header of a file, rendering it unopenable | 0.1
`--max` | (real number, 0.0 - 1.0) - the upper bound of the file to replace bytes in. you might use this to avoid corrupting the footer of a file, rendering it unopenable | 0.9
`-c, --continuous` | if set to true, this will randomly decide to replace the next byte after the last one was replaced. you might do this to get "runs" of replaced bytes in a row instead of just scattered, randomly replaced pixels | true
`-C, --continuousChance` | (real number, 0.0 - 1.0) the chance, in decimal format, of the next byte being continuous. 0.6 = 60%, 0.2 = 20%, etc. | 0.6

## Examples?

You betcha!

Here's the `byebyte` "logo" after running it through `byebyte`:

```
node index.js -f byebyte.jpg -o byebytebroke.jpg -t 100
```

We can even do it again:

Here's the command:

```
node index.js -f byebyte.jpg -o byebytebroke.jpg -t 13000
```

Here's the result:

BMPs have really simplistic data, so breaking them doesn't do a ton.

### video

Here's a cool, comforting video: [find comfort in the light. // full moon timelapse](https://vimeo.com/135133471)

Here's the end example of my destroying parts of it and exporting a single part from the destroyed video as a GIF:
